# Row Health-Visualization
Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories that spans from topics like wellness tips, plan affordability, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

A data team was hired to assist in analyzing their data and to help form actionable insights that will capitalize on their marketing budget. The company aims to create a better understanding of the campaign catergories options and how they relate to signups and claims from patients.

The analysis will involve a dynamic visualization that the marketing team can use to create self-serve insights and regular reporting. The current goal is to investigate the relationship between the marketing metrics, signup metrics, and claims metric within the various categories.
